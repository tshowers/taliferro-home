									<img src="/assets/images/team-slider2.webp" alt="Booker Tyrone Showers" class="img-fluid rounded float-start me-5 mb-5"> When I'm hired to do a job, I can help you to design new
									processes and improve existing ones with an eye on improving efficiency, productivity, and revenue.
								</p>
								<p class="wow fadeInUp"> A good process design will help with current work and future projects. When I design processes, I think about the following things: </p>
								<ul class="wow fadeInUp">
									<li>How can we make this more efficient?</li>
									<li>How can we make this easier to understand?</li>
									<li>How can we make it better aligned with our company's goals?</li>
								</ul>
								<div class="wow slideInLeft">
									<strong>I can help you build a team culture that supports practical work</strong>
								</div>
								<p class="wow fadeInUp"> Culture is an essential part of a company. It reflects the values, beliefs, and goals of those who work for it. Culture is also an expression
									of its leadership: </p>
								<ul class="wow fadeInUp">
									<li>How they treat their employees and make decisions.</li>
									<li>What types of projects do they choose to pursue.</li>
									<li>How they reward hard work or punish laziness. </li>
								</ul>
								<p class="wow fadeInUp"> Culture is not only influenced by these factors; it plays a crucial role in defining them. If your culture is toxic, people will feel it's okay
									to misbehave because that's how things are done —it becomes acceptable behavior because no one else seems bothered by it. This can lead to poor performance (as
									anyone who has ever worked in this kind of environment knows), but even worse than poor performance is when people leave because they don't feel safe working there
									anymore. And if you've lost talent like that before? Well, then, maybe your best bet would be hiring someone with experience building teams from scratch where there
									wasn't any before—someone like me! </p>
								<div class="wow slideInLeft">
									<strong class="wow slideInLeft"> I can get you a promotion </strong>
								</div>
								<p class="wow fadeInUp"> I have helped more than a few of my previous bosses/clients get promotions. I helped them achieve their goals and meet the requirements for
									promotion by assisting them to achieve their personal, career, financial, and life goals. </p>
								<div class="wow slideInLeft">
									<strong class="wow slideInLeft"> I can help your company make informed hiring decisions </strong>
								</div>
								<p class="wow fadeInUp"> Hiring the right people is one of the most important things you can do as a company. You have to hire people who are not just skilled but also
									fit into the organization's culture and overall mission. </p>
								<p class="wow fadeInUp"> I'll be able to help you make informed hiring decisions because I know what makes an employee successful in your industry, and I can use that
									knowledge to evaluate candidates based on their personality, skillset, and attitude. This will allow you to avoid making bad hires who won't fit in with either your
									company or its mission. </p>
								<div class="wow slideInLeft">
									<strong class="wow slideInLeft"> I have experience in software development both before and after the agile process was commonly used </strong>
								</div>
								<p class="wow fadeInUp"> I've worked at companies that only used waterfall processes, where you developed all the features before releasing them to customers. I have
									also worked at companies that use agile methodologies. We continuously deliver small chunks of new functionality over time to our users instead of waiting until
									everything is done before releasing it all at once. </p>
								<p class="wow fadeInUp"> As a result of these different experiences in different environments with different teams on various projects using different technologies, I
									can bring knowledge from many other areas together into one role for your company: </p>
								<div class="wow slideInLeft">
									<strong class="wow slideInLeft"> Hiring me will allow the company to manage its teams and processes better, leading to increased efficiency, productivity, and
										revenue </strong>
								</div>
								<p class="wow fadeInUp"> I can help build a team culture that supports practical work. I have experience leading teams and creating processes that help people get their
									jobs done efficiently and effectively. In one of my previous roles, I helped the company design new techniques for hiring and onboarding new employees and improving
									existing ones to speed up the development process. </p>
								<p class="wow fadeInUp"> In addition to being an expert at building strong teams and improving processes, one of my strengths is making informed hiring decisions based
									on data analysis. For example, during my previous job as Cheif Architect at PK Global, my team developed an algorithm that predicts which applicants will make good
									hires based on their resumes' keywords and formatting style. This algorithm allowed us to accurately predict whether or not an applicant would be successful within
									three days after submitting their resume—and we could do it with 98% accuracy! </p>
								<p class="wow fadeInUp"> Hiring me is an excellent investment that will pay off in the long run. I'm confident that my experience and knowledge will help your company
									improve its processes and increase productivity over time. </p>

									<div class="review-text">
										<p class="wow fadeInUp">Ty has been a technical subject matter expert for RESTful API design on my team since 2010. Ty authored the bulk of AT&T’s Guidelines
											for RESTful API Design. This document is an extremely useful compendium of best practices that we have used to drive consistency across APIs. The AT&T model
											has been to allow multiple diverse teams to create APIs that provide access to their technical services. In this model, it is critical that there be some
											standards that enable these teams to create APIs that can be easily consumed. This common approach allows developers consuming these APIs to understand and
											use these diverse services quickly and easily. In addition to authoring these standards for AT&T, Ty also sits as a member of the governing body that
											evaluated all APIs externally exposed by the company. Ty’s role on the “Northbound API Governance Board” has been to determine whether these emerging APIs
											adhere to RESTful guidelines and are appropriately useable for the developer community. Finally, in addition to authoring the standards and governing on
											their adherence, Ty plays an important consultative role with teams creating APIs. During the API design phase, countless teams have reached out for Ty’s
											guidance and he has helped them with a more effective RESTful design from the outset. This step has saved a tremendous amount of time by advising teams on
											how to pass the governance review ahead of time. Ty is a skilled API standards resource. However, I want to be sure to point out that Ty also has critical
											soft skills that make him a valuable member of the team. Ty has a very engaging personality and is a much more effective verbal communicator than most
											technical resources. I could see Ty doing an outstanding job as an API Evangelist or within Technical Sales. In summary, Ty has solid technical skills and
											outstanding people skills. I would strongly urge you to consider his candidacy for a wide range of positions. </p>

										<p class="wow fadeInUp"> During my duration at T­Mobile, Ty was an excellent addition to the team. Prior to Ty’s arrival the team was struggling, especially
											between the UI and the API layers, often with each team saying the other team was not following the correct approach. Ty was a key resource in getting the
											team on track and successfully communicate between the canvas team, API, and UDP team to ensure each of the teams were following industry best practices as
											well as follow application architecture standards. Ty developed proper architecture deliverables and pushed to have them all reviwe by the team, such as
											security, caching strategy, implementation plan, technology plan, and capability roadmap. For example: Ty took the lead in partnering with the Azure team to
											ensure the application followed T­mobile’s Azure design principles. Ty also partnered witth the securitty organizaiton to ensure that proper application
											security processes, and most importantly Ty took the lead to partner with EDP Pipeline to develop T­Mobiles first pipeline utilizing Azure. Towards the end
											of my time at T­Mobile, there was confusion in what the client was looking for in a future state architecture. Ty had developed a future state that
											leveraged many of the existing components, it was unclear that the client was truly looking for a future state ignoring what was in place today. This was
											not identified until after our second review meeting, when I specifically asked the question to the stakeholder. This was particulary challenging situation,
											as each of the tracks (UDP, API, UI) had expressed need, that Ty was taking into account. In the end I would love the opportunity to work with Ty in the
											future and respect in knowledge as an architect, and most importantly, his ability to overcome difficult sitiations. </p>

										<p class="wow fadeInUp"> I would like to admire Ty Showers for his work as a member of Asset Management Project in T­Mobile in few words during my journey with
											him till date. Ty is always driven and motivated with his work. He is very clear about what he owns within the department. Ty is a great asset to the team.
											He is very professional and focused in his work. Despite the difficult deadlines he maintains a positive attitude. He always responds to problems without
											getting angry or frustrated. His most outstanding “value” from what I have seen is his attitude towards continuous improvement. Always greeting with a smile
											is his forte which makes other co­workers like myself and others work energetically and focus on what is being done what needs to be done. The way of
											understanding his Architectural works like design flow, technical flow Department/Team wise is always crisp and clear when Ty puts them into words and
											pictorial representations apart from his other excellent works. Any Project is likely to be shallow and hollow without a valuable asset like Ty. </p>

										<p class="wow fadeInUp"> I just wanted to commend Ty Showers on his excellent work as an architect for the T-Mobile Canvas project. He is extremely
											knowledgeable about best practices and ideal state architecture for API applications. He addresses customer concerns with industry experts and software
											vendors (such as Azure) to ensure his proposed solutions are feasible and meet customer requirements. He clarifies requirements that are vague or do not
											align with industry best practice to advise the customer of a better solution and to ensure the customer understands potential pitfalls. He was a pleasure
											to work with and found many details we had not considered that were crucial to our future state plans. He followed all T-Mobile standards and formats to
											provide detailed explanations of his proposed implementation, which, upon review with Azure, was the exact solution they would have created for us. Ty’s
											wealth of knowledge and dedication to providing sound, scalable architecture would best be leveraged within an organization where management does not think
											of themselves as architects. </p>
