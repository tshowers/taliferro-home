										<h3>Ed Lambert   </h3>
										<p>Director, Developer Advocacy
											AT&T Technology Development</p>
									</div>
									<div class="review-text">
										<p>Ty has been a technical subject matter expert for RESTful API design on my team since 2010.
											Ty authored the bulk of AT&T’s Guidelines for RESTful API Design.  This document is an extremely useful compendium of best practices that we have used to drive consistency across APIs.  
											The AT&T model has been to allow multiple diverse teams to create APIs that provide access to their technical services.   In this model, it is critical that there be some standards that enable these teams to create APIs that can be easily consumed.   This common approach allows developers consuming these APIs to understand and use these diverse services quickly and easily.
											In addition to authoring these standards for AT&T, Ty also sits as a member of the governing body that evaluated all APIs externally exposed by the company.  Ty’s role on the “Northbound API Governance Board” has been to determine whether these emerging APIs adhere to RESTful guidelines and are appropriately useable for the developer community.
											Finally, in addition to authoring the standards and governing on their adherence, Ty plays an important consultative role with teams creating APIs.  During the API design phase, countless teams have reached out for Ty’s guidance and he has helped them with a more effective RESTful design from the outset.  This step has saved a tremendous amount of time by advising teams on how to pass the governance review ahead of time.
											Ty is a skilled API standards resource.  However, I want to be sure to point out that Ty also has critical soft skills that make him a valuable member of the team.  Ty has a very engaging personality and is a much more effective verbal communicator than most technical resources.  I could see Ty doing an outstanding job as an API Evangelist or within Technical Sales.
											In summary, Ty has solid technical skills and outstanding people skills.  I would strongly urge you to consider his candidacy for a wide range of positions. </p>

										<p> Ty sits as a member of the North Bound API Governance team representing the Developer Advocacy group to ensure that APIs that are to be published by AT&T adhere to RESTful best practices, as defined by the industry as well as defined internally by AT&T. I would say he would have seen hundreds of RESTful API designs and implementations (in various flavors) for approval till now. Also, not to forget that those are not any theories or hypothesis but real world implementations. </p>

										<p> During my duration at T­Mobile, Ty was an excellent addition to the team. Prior to Ty’s arrival the team was struggling, especially between the UI and the API layers, often with each team saying the other team was not following the correct approach. Ty was a key resource in getting the team on track and successfully communicate between the canvas team, API, and UDP team to ensure each of the teams were following industry best practices as well as follow application architecture standards.
											Ty developed proper architecture deliverables and pushed to have them all reviwe by the team, such as security, caching strategy, implementation plan, technology plan, and capability roadmap. For example: Ty took the lead in partnering with the Azure team to ensure the application followed T­mobile’s Azure design principles. Ty also partnered witth the securitty organizaiton to ensure that proper application security processes, and most importantly Ty took the lead to partner with EDP Pipeline to develop T­Mobiles first pipeline utilizing Azure.
											
											Towards the end of my time at T­Mobile, there was confusion in what the client was looking for in a future state architecture. Ty had developed a future state that leveraged many of the existing components, it was unclear that the client was truly looking for a future state ignoring what was in place today. This was not identified until after our second review meeting, when I specifically asked the question to the stakeholder. This was particulary challenging situation, as each of the tracks (UDP, API, UI) had expressed need, that Ty was taking into account.
											In the end I would love the opportunity to work with Ty in the future and respect in knowledge as an architect, and most importantly, his ability to overcome difficult sitiations. </p>

										<p> I would like to admire Ty Showers for his work as a member of Asset Management Project in T­Mobile in few words during my journey with him till date.
											Ty is always driven and motivated with his work. He is very clear about what he owns within the department.
											Ty is a great asset to the team. He is very professional and focused in his work. Despite the difficult deadlines he maintains a positive attitude. He always responds to problems without getting angry or frustrated.
											His most outstanding “value” from what I have seen is his attitude towards continuous improvement.
											Always greeting with a smile is his forte which makes other co­workers like myself and others work energetically and focus on what is being done what needs to be done.
											The way of understanding his Architectural works like design flow, technical flow Department/Team wise is always crisp and clear when Ty puts them into words and pictorial representations apart from his other excellent works.
											Any Project is likely to be shallow and hollow without a valuable asset like Ty. </p>

										<p> I came to know recently that Ty is off the project and honestly it came as surprise to me. It was great pleasure working with Ty discussing various architecture requirements and best practices for the project. His valuable inputs really helped in shaping early aspects of Canvas especially when each of our teams were not aligned. As you are the reporting manager I wanted to say that he was valuable asset on the team. </p>

										<h3>Sommer Anderson</h3>
										<p>T-Mobile</p>
									</div>
									<div class="review-text">
										<p> I just wanted to commend Ty Showers on his excellent work as an architect for the T-Mobile Canvas project. He is extremely knowledgeable about best practices and ideal state architecture for API applications. He addresses customer concerns with industry experts and software vendors (such as Azure) to ensure his proposed solutions are feasible and meet customer requirements. He clarifies requirements that are vague or do not align with industry best practice to advise the customer of a better solution and to ensure the customer understands potential pitfalls. He was a pleasure to work with and found many details we had not considered that were crucial to our future state plans. He followed all T-Mobile standards and formats to provide detailed explanations of his proposed implementation, which, upon review with Azure, was the exact solution they would have created for us. Ty’s wealth of knowledge and dedication to providing sound, scalable architecture would best be leveraged within an organization where management does not think of themselves as architects. </p>

										<p> I was asked to sit in on one of his API Dev Team interviews where he works with the team to understand their API, tech stack and the various Use Cases. 
											What I observed was Tyrone’s very methodical and centered approach at surfacing the right amount of detail from the team to help assess the Security Posture
											of the API in question.  Often in these types of interviews the team being interviewed is already on edge, fearing judgement of their quality yet Tyrone was
											able to keep the team centered and on task.  It was a pleasure to hear him in action. </p>
