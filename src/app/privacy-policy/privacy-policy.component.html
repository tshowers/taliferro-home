                            <p  class="wow fadeInUp"> This site is owned by Taliferro Group. This Privacy Policy is designed to tell you about our practices regarding collection, use, and disclosure of information that
                                you may provide via this site. Please be sure to read this entire Privacy Policy before using, or submitting information, to this site. This site is intended for
                                use by residents of the United States. </p>
                            <h3> Your Consent</h3>
                            <p  class="wow fadeInUp"> By using this site, you agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy. Whenever you submit information via this site, you consent to the collection, use, and
                                disclosure of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Active Information Collection </p>
                            <p  class="wow fadeInUp"> Like many Web sites, this site actively collects information from its visitors both by asking you specific questions and by permitting you to communicate with us
                                directly via e-mail, feedback form, and/or chat room. Some of the information that you submit may be personally identifiable information (that is, information that
                                can be uniquely identified with you, such as your full name, address, e-mail address, phone number, and so on). Some areas of this site may require you to submit
                                information in order for you to benefit from the specified features (such as newsletter subscriptions, tips/pointers, order processing) or to participate in a
                                particular activity (such as sweepstakes or other promotions). You will be informed at each information collection point what information is required and what
                                information is optional. </p>
                            <h3> Passive Information Collection </h3>
                            <p  class="wow fadeInUp"> As you navigate through a Web site, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without actively providing the information) using various
                                technologies and means, such as Internet Protocol addresses, cookies, Internet tags, and navigational data collection. This site uses Internet Protocol (IP)
                                addresses. An IP Address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet and is generally considered to be
                                non-personally identifiable information, because in most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique
                                to a particular user’s computer). We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our server, report aggregate information, determine the fastest route for your
                                computer to use in connecting to our site, and administer and improve the site. A “cookie” is a bit of information that a Web site sends to your Web browser that
                                helps the site remember information about you and your preferences. We do use cookies at this site. </p>
                            <p  class="wow fadeInUp"> “Internet tags” (also known as single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) are smaller than cookies and tell the Web site server information
                                such as the IP address and browser type related to the visitor's computer. </p>
                            <p  class="wow fadeInUp"> We do use Internet tags at this site. </p>
                            <p  class="wow fadeInUp"> “Navigational data” (“log files,” “server logs,” and “clickstream” data) are used for system management, to improve the content of the site, market research
                                purposes, and to communicate information to visitors. </p>
                            <p  class="wow fadeInUp"> This site uses navigational data. </p>
                            <h3> Use and Disclosure of Information </h3>
                            <p  class="wow fadeInUp"> Except as otherwise stated, we may use your information to improve the content of our site, to customize the site to your preferences, to communicate information to
                                you (if you have requested it), for our marketing and research purposes, and for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy. If you provide personally
                                identifiable information to this site, we will not combine such information with other actively collected information. We will take reasonable measures to prevent
                                personally identifiable information from being combined with passively collected information, unless you consent otherwise. We will not disclose your personal
                                information to any company. Access and Correction </p>
                            <p  class="wow fadeInUp"> To keep your personally identifiable information accurate, current, and complete, please contact us as specified below. We will take reasonable steps to update or
                                correct personally identifiable information in our possession that you have previously submitted via this site. </p>
                            <h3> Security </h3>
                            <p  class="wow fadeInUp"> We take reasonable steps to protect your personally identifiable information as you transmit your information from your computer to our site and to protect such
                                information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. You should keep in mind that no Internet transmission is ever 100%
                                secure or error-free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from this site may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you
                                send to us via e-mail. Moreover, where you use passwords, ID numbers, or other special access features on this site, it is your responsibility to safeguard them.
                            </p>
