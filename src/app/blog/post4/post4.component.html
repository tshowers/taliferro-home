                            <h2 class=" wow fadeInUp"> Introduction </h2>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp">In this day and age, everyone wants to be on social media. And with good reason – the Internet is an excellent tool for reaching your target market. Still, there's so much wrong information out there, that your potential customers could be misinformed about your products and services. The solution? Utilizing the right sales and marketing technologies to help you reach your target market, generate leads, and increase sales automatically without spending all day on them yourself. </p>
                            <p  class="wow fadeInUp">The only thing left to do is create a fantastic customer experience that will set you apart from other businesses trying to make a quick buck online.</p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp">
                                At Taliferro Group, we're not a social media marketing company. We provide customer experience engineering technology which may include social media marketing. We use the right tools and create an experience that engages your audience on all channels—from email to print, digital advertising, and in-person events.</p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp">Competing with established brands with large budgets is daunting if you are new to the market.</p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp">Start small and focus on what you can do well. In the beginning, focus on making a few friends who can help spread the word about your product or service. Don't try to be everything to everyone right off the bat! Be realistic about your budget; don't hire Google AdWords experts when you only have $500 to spend per month because they will tell you they need at least $10K per month just for their fees. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp">Look into other more affordable options such as Facebook Ads or Instagram influencers who charge by impressions rather than clicks/click-throughs. Facebook may work better, given how much cheaper these platforms are compared to Google AdWords. Google AdWords charges by both clicks/clicks-throughs and impressions.  </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80">Be patient and persistent; it may take some time before any results are evident, but never give up hope. Remember that Rome wasn't built in one day either, so keep pushing forward despite setbacks.</p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Target Market </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp">When you're trying to reach a new audience, it's difficult to grab their attention when there are already so many distractions online. To do this, you need something extraordinary to give people a reason to pay attention to what you have to say—but how?
                                When potential customers search for answers from their mobile devices, you want them to get the correct information about your offerings on social media.
                                Do you want potential customers to get the wrong information about your products and services? No, of course not. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80">Taliferro Group develops integrated marketing solutions. We create Customer Experience Engineering technology that helps companies increase engagement across all channels of their target audiences.</p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Social media is a powerful tool </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp">Facebook is a powerful tool for reaching your target market because you can target specific groups of people based on their interests or demographics. If you're selling luxury watches online and want to get affluent men ages 35-60 who live in San Francisco, then no need to go any further than Facebook.</p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp">With proper management, social media can also be a platform to generate genuine leads who are interested in what you have to offer.
                                Social media is also a great place to generate genuine leads interested in what you offer. 
                                Navigating through all the online marketing tools can be very time-consuming and overwhelming while trying to do all you can to grow your business.</p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80">You are so busy running your business and trying to grow it that you don't want to waste time with tools you don't need. Not only is this important for your sanity, but it is also critical if you want to make sure the money in your marketing budget gets spent on things that help grow your business and create leads. That's why we have created a technology platform where we help people navigate through all the marketing tools available online, so they can quickly identify what works best for them.</p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> There is no shortage of opportunities to advertise </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80">There is no shortage of opportunities to advertise on social media platforms such as Google Ads, Facebook Business Manager, and Instagram Advertising through Facebook, but not every company has the knowledge or experience to use them effectively.
                                This is why we created Customer Experience Engineering to improve how businesses market themselves. Our algorithms collect data from various sources and analyze it to provide insights that advertisers can use when creating campaigns or improving existing ones.</p>
                            <h2 class=" wow fadeInUp"> Conclusion </h2>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80">Sometimes it can be overwhelming for a small business owner to navigate through all these online marketing tools. When you have more than one social media platform needing management, manually scheduling posts becomes very tedious and time-consuming. We can alleviate this burden.</p>
