                            <h2 class="wow fadeInUp"> Introduction </h2>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> People don't want to be sold, but the good news is that there's always a way around that. There are ways to approach someone even though they don't
                                know you that can help you form a connection. A prospect is more likely to listen when you have something important to say. This article will look at strategies for
                                approaching strangers about your product or service in person and online. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Empathize with your prospect's point of view </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> To effectively approach a prospect, it's essential to put yourself in your prospect's shoes. You can ask questions and listen carefully to what
                                they have to say. You can also show empathy by acknowledging that you understand their situation. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Focus on their benefits, not the features of your product or service </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> You might think that the best way to convince a customer to buy your product is by focusing on the features of your product or service. After all,
                                everyone knows what a feature is—it's the "what" of the product: how it works, what it does, and how it can help them. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> But when it comes down to it, benefits are much more important than features. Benefits speak to a customer's needs and want—they make them want to
                                buy from you (and only you). That's why I recommend that when someone asks you about your business or offers suggestions for how they could use your products or
                                services differently, focus on highlighting the benefits first. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Tell a story </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> The second thing you need to do is tell a story. Tell a story about how your product or service helped someone. Use real numbers and specific
                                details, focusing on benefits rather than features. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> A personal story can be beneficial. "I used this product/service to..." or "When I was doing X, I had problems with Y." Here's an example: "I
                                didn't know what type of business I wanted to start until my Dad showed me his website building tool — it helped me get my site up and running so fast!" </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> You should use stories illustrating how you came up with your product/service idea in the first place — "I noticed that X happened in industry Y"
                                or "I was trying to solve problem Z." </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Don't bad mouth or slight the competition </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> You should avoid discussing your competition unless it's relevant to the conversation. For example, if someone mentions that they like working with
                                another company and are interested in their services as well as yours, then go ahead and say how you're different from them. But if someone asks for help deciding
                                between two available products (both of which are made by companies other than yours), don't say anything negative about either company. Instead of saying, "I think
                                Product A is better than Product B," say something like, "Product A works differently than Product B. Feel free to check out both options." </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> Also, remember that this advice applies not only when you're selling a product or service, but anywhere you spend time with people—not just at
                                work. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Help them see your vision for them </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Once you clearly understand your product or service and its benefits, it's time for you to communicate it to the prospect. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> What is your product or service? What are the benefits of using it? How does it fit in with their goals and ambitions? How does it help them
                                achieve their goals? </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Write a good subject line for an email, tweet, or message </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> When you're reaching out to someone you don't know, the subject line is one of the most critical parts of an email. It should be clear and concise
                                and not have anything in it that will make a reader feel like they need to "unsubscribe" from your emails or avoid them altogether (like "Hey!" or "This thing
                                happened!"). </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> Like a tweet or other social media message, I think "Hi [name]!" is a good default for subject lines. This makes it personal—you're addressing this
                                person by name, so they know who's contacting them—and friendly. You could also use something like: "You might be interested in…" or "My new product/service..." but
                                avoid using generic phrases like these because they don't stand out as much as more personalized ones. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Get to the point quickly in face-to-face communication </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> It can be challenging to get your point across in one-on-one communication. It would help if you did it quickly and with conviction. Don't waste a
                                prospect's time, and don't be afraid to ask for what you want. </p>
                            <ul class="wow fadeInUp mb--80">
                                <li> Ask them directly if you can meet with them at their convenience, so they know when the meeting will take place. This is important because no one likes being put
                                    on the spot like this—they might not have time available, or they might have something else going on that day/weekend/month (like a family event or an out-of-town
                                    trip). Scheduling ahead of time gives people options that help keep things organized for both parties involved in setting up a meeting (and it also shows respect
                                    towards them). </li>
                                <li> Ask for what you want: Don't hesitate when asking strangers about business opportunities, such as working together on projects like web design projects, marketing
                                    campaigns, writing articles, etc. Get straight into talking about what product or service would benefit them best since every person has different needs related to
                                    these services. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Be polite and respectful when you approach a stranger </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Be polite and concerned about their time when you ask if they have a moment to chat. </p>
                            <ul class="wow fadeInUp mb--80">
                                <li> Ask if it's a good time to chat. </li>
                                <li> Be brief and to the point when explaining your product or service, making sure to mention what makes yours different from others on the market. </li>
                                <li> Don't be pushy or aggressive; if they say no thanks, then don't try again—there will be someone else who enjoys talking about their interests. You may have to wait
                                    for them to finish with something or pause what they're doing if they're in the middle of something important. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Share that their input is valuable to you, and clarify how much you'd like to hear their thoughts </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> The most important thing to remember when approaching a stranger is to be polite and kind. Be open, honest, and willing to listen. You want to
                                ensure you are not being pushy or overly aggressive in your approach. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> It's also vital that you share that their input is valuable to you and clarify how much you'd like to hear their thoughts. If the person is
                                hesitant about talking about what they do for a living, try asking them about another topic instead of jumping straight into business talk. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> At the end of your conversation (or earlier), ask if it's OK if you follow up with them once you've made some adjustments per their feedback. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> When approaching a stranger about your product or service, you should have specific numbers in mind. If possible, try to learn the number of
                                employees at their company, approximate revenue, etc. This shows that you've done your homework and want to tailor your offer for them specifically. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> It's easy to find this information online, look up their name on LinkedIn, search for them on Google and then check out their company's website (or
                                even call the phone number listed). </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Take rejection graciously </h3>
                            <ul class="wow fadeInUp mb--80">
                                <li> Don't take it personally if they say no, especially if they give you feedback on how to improve your product or service </li>
                                <li> Thank them for their time. </li>
                                <li> Ask if it's OK to follow up with them later. </li>
                                <li> Be positive and professional! Don't badmouth the person or your product/service in any way; they may be a friend or family member of someone with influence over
                                    your prospects, so be polite and friendly even if you have been rejected. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> There are ways to approach someone even though they don't know you that can help you form a connection </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Tell a story. This will help them see themselves using your service and hopefully make them feel like they need it in their life. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> Focus on their benefits, not the features of the product or service. Help them see your vision for them (and why it's better than what else is out
                                there) </p>
                            <h2 class="wow fadeInUp"> Conclusion </h2>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> The bottom line is that people don't want to be sold; they want to be engaged. When you can create a connection with someone – whether through
                                empathy or storytelling – your odds of getting them interested in what you're doing increases dramatically. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> If you can do this while respecting their time and avoiding common pitfalls like badmouthing competitors, you'll be well on making more sales. </p>
