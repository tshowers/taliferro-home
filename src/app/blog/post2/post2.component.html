                            <h3 class="text-capitalize title mb--30  wow fadeInUp"> Your website is just an expense, right? </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp">You paid someone to build it and have to pay a monthly hosting fee. You use it to show people your business and share information about your products and services.</p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp">Many small business owners view their website as an expense rather than an investment. They pay someone to build it, then use it for advertising and marketing purposes. It's where you showcase who you are and what products or services you offer, but that's about it.</p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp">However, suppose your site isn't generating any new leads or sales for your business? It doesn't matter how much you spent on the design or web developer because they didn't provide a return on investment (ROI). The problem is that most people who have websites don't know how to market them effectively. That's why we've put together this guide on making your website worth its weight in gold by turning those visitors into customers through content marketing strategies like blogging and social media marketing with Facebook Ads.</p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp">That's not wrong, but your site can do much more than be an online brochure. It should. If you aren't using your website as a sales tool, you're missing out on countless opportunities to turn visitors into buyers.</p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80">Your website is an essential part of your business. It should be used to sell your products and services, collect customer data, communicate with your customers, and generate leads.</p>
                            <h3 class="text-capitalize title mb--30 wow fadeInUp"> But how do you know if your site is helping or hurting your sales? </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp">When you look at the backend of your site, there's a lot of confusing data that tells you what's happening on the front end (your actual website). But how can this help you sell more products and services?</p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp">The answer lies in understanding both types of data. It would help if you learned how to use backend analytics to understand people's actions when they visit your site. And then use frontend metrics like bounce rate and time spent on the page to optimize conversions.</p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp">Data shows us where we need to improve and where we're succeeding.
                                Data helps you understand what your customers are looking for and what they like and dislike about your website. It also lets you know how well your website performs in terms of conversion rate, bounce rate, and time on site.</p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80">If you're not collecting data from your websites, then making informed decisions about their performance or improvement is impossible.</p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30  wow fadeInUp"> Conclusion </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> So, is your website making money? If it's not, you need to invest in some new technology or hire an someone that can help you.  The key takeaway here is that it takes both time and money to create an effective website but if done right it will
                                pay dividends for years. </p>
