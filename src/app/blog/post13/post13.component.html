                            <h2> Introduction </h2>
                            <p  class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> CRM (Customer Relationship Management) is integral to any marketing strategy. A CRM aims to build a closer relationship with customers than they have with each other or
                                anyone else. It's used to organize contacts, manage relationships with them, and help you keep track of their preferences and history so that you can tailor your
                                marketing efforts appropriately in the future. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> What is CRM? </h3>
                            <p  class="wow fadeInUp"> Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a system that helps you organize your contacts, track your sales and manage your customers. In short: it's a way of managing
                                the relationship between you and those who buy from you. </p>
                            <p  class="wow fadeInUp"> The importance of a CRM grows as the number of interactions between companies and their customer's increases. With so many channels available to reach out to potential
                                clients, it can be challenging to track where they've come from and what they've done in the past. </p>
                            <p  class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> CRM helps business owners stay organized by providing a place to store all the information about their customers' preferences, buying habits, and contact preferences.

                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Challenges of CRM in Marketing </h3>
                            <p  class="wow fadeInUp"> CRM is a challenge for marketers because customer data is dispersed across multiple systems and not accurate or available to the right people. </p>
                            <ul class=" mb--80">
                                <li>Customer data is not accessible: The lack of integration between systems means that even if you have access to all your customers' information, it's not in one
                                    place and, therefore, difficult to access. For example, if you have sales data but don't have marketing automation software to analyze it, you won't get the
                                    insights needed for your campaigns. </li>
                                <li>Poor customer experience: If your system isn't set up correctly, this can lead to poor customer experiences like missed emails or phone calls. Plus, there are
                                    always delays in processing orders—and as we know from personal experience (or just watching TV), customers don't like waiting around. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> How to choose a CRM solution for marketing </h3>
                            <p  class="wow fadeInUp"> A successful marketing strategy requires managing all aspects of your business, including sales leads and customer relationships. CRMs have been around for about 25
                                years and have evolved from simple to complex. </p>
                            <p  class="wow fadeInUp"> If you want to improve your marketing efforts, a customer relationship management (CRM) solution may be the right tool. CRMs help companies manage customer data and
                                interactions in one place, so they can keep track of what's happening with customers throughout their relationship with the brand. </p>
