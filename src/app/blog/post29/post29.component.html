                            <h2 class="wow fadeInUp"> Introduction </h2>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> I've been an IT Consultant for over ten years. In that time, I learned that everyone wants to be promoted at work. It's natural to want
                                recognition, and it's also a good idea to want more money. But more than anything else, what my clients crave is the feeling of being appreciated by their superiors—and
                                when their coworkers (and even clients) look up to them as an expert in their field. In other words, they want people to think they are fantastic. And if you can help
                                them get there? Not only will your client feel great about themselves, but so will you. Now here's how you can help your client get promoted. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Give them something to be promoted for </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> The easiest way to get your clients a promotion is to help them with a project that they are passionate about. This will be the most
                                effective and rewarding way for them to demonstrate their skills and abilities, leading to the ability to earn more money and make a more significant impact on their
                                organization. If you can find out what they want to do in the future, even better. Do they want to be promoted? What would it take? Is an open position available at
                                higher levels in their company that might be a good fit for them? Find out what those things are so that you can make sure that when people look at your client's resume
                                or application for another job, all of these things come together nicely. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Help them build a case for their promotion. </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Before you start helping your client get promoted, ensure you have all the information needed to build a strong case for them. If they don't have
                                enough experience and knowledge to do their job well, then focus on getting them some experience and knowledge first. This will help them learn more about what is
                                expected from them in their role and how they can improve over time. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> Next, consider what makes a good case for someone else's promotion. Should this person be paid more because they are great at communicating
                                with customers? Are there any awards or other accolades that show this person's exceptionality? What skills does this person possess that would benefit their
                                organization if used more often? Answering these questions will allow you to present evidence showing why your client deserves a promotion based on their ability rather
                                than just telling people who will decide whether or not they get what they want to hear (e.g., "this employee has been loyal"). </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Help them get noticed </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Now that you know what they want, it's time to ask for it. The key to making this process work is being specific about the request; don't just tell
                                someone "I want them to get promoted." Instead, focus on the details: "I want them to get promoted by X date and be given Y title/role/responsibility. If I could also
                                get Z in there too, that would be fantastic!" </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Remember that this is a collaborative project between you and your client—you should agree on what success looks like before starting down any path
                                together. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> If all goes according to plan with this strategy, then congratulations! However, if things don't go as smoothly or aren't possible at this
                                time due to external factors outside both parties' control, don't worry: There's always next year. Your client will have achieved their professional goals faster than
                                expected, thanks largely because of your efforts on their behalf. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Help them build relationships with the right people </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> To help your client get promoted, you can help them build relationships with people who can help them. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> It sounds obvious - but it's not always as easy as it sounds. People who are good at networking know how to make friends and build relationships
                                with the right people. They know what to say, how to be authentic and genuine in their interactions, and they understand that building strong relationships takes time
                                and effort. If your client is new to networking, or if they're struggling to see why it matters (or even don't quite feel comfortable doing it yet), here are some tips
                                for helping them on their way: </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Help them understand the importance of networking and why it will help them achieve their goals. For example: "Networking isn't just about getting
                                new business; it's also about building stronger connections with other professionals who share similar interests." Or "Networking helps you learn from others'
                                experiences." Or "Networking leads directly into job opportunities." </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> Explain how important it is for them to have a wide range of contacts in different fields so that when an opportunity arises outside their
                                current area of expertise, they'll have someone ready at hand whom they can ask for advice or support with information gathering/researching etc. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Talk about their future career goals </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> The best way to help your client is to discuss their future career goals. Ask them what they want to do in the future and if there are any
                                areas where they'd like to develop more skills or experience. You can also talk about what kind of salary or title they would like in the next year, five years, or ten
                                years from now. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Be honest about their chances </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Before you start talking about how to get your client a promotion, it's essential, to be honest about their chances. If you think they have a
                                chance, tell them. But if you don't think they have an opportunity, or even if they do, but they don't realize it, tell them that too. The more information they have
                                going into the interview process, the better off they'll be—and in turn, so will your relationship with them. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Sometimes getting your client a promotion is as simple as helping them do their job better. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> It's best to start by asking what they want to achieve and how they envision doing it. If they tell you that they want to get promoted but can't
                                articulate what value they will add or how their skills and experience make them the best candidate, there isn't much we can do here other than offer encouragement and
                                support. But if the client has done some research and comes up with an action plan on how they can demonstrate their value to get promoted, then that's something we can
                                work with. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> For example: let's say your client has been working in accounting for 3 years but wants to move into marketing so she can learn about
                                consumer trends and social media—and eventually become a brand ambassador for her company at industry events. She believes these transferable skills will allow her more
                                advancement opportunities later. What does this mean? It means she needs an opportunity where she has the chance (1) demonstrate her ability with those soft skills; (2)
                                show off her new knowledge of consumer behavior; and (3) put those two things together into some kind of coherent pitch that showcases how she could be valuable in this
                                new role. </p>
                            <h2 class="wow fadeInUp"> Conclusion </h2>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> As you can see, getting your client a promotion isn't always as simple as writing them a letter or making a phone call. But it should be
                                possible if they work hard and do their job well. And if not, well, then maybe they don't deserve one anyway. </p>
