                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp">Taliferro Group is an agile IT services partner </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp">Agile is a set of principles and practices for software development that promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development and delivery, a time-boxed iterative approach, and continuous improvement. Agile methods encourage rapid and flexible responses to change over following a plan. </p>
                            <p class=" mb--80">DevOps is a methodology that improves communication between developers and IT operations staff. By working together, these teams can develop technology more efficiently: through continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD). CI refers to committing code changes into a source repository several times daily, while CD refers to deploying those changes automatically onto servers or virtual machines (VMs). Businesses can use CI/CD to update their software faster than ever to respond quickly to market conditions.</p>

                            <p class="wow fadeInUp">API-driven applications are web services accessed by mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets over an internet connection. These apps make it easier for users who
                                may not have in-depth technical skillsets like website development knowledge. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp">APIGEE is one of the most popular API management solutions today. It helps companies build, secure, and manage their APIs by providing tools that eliminate the need for
                                custom coding or manual integration. More than 5,000 organizations worldwide (including Intuit, eBay, and Walmart) use APIGEE's services to integrate their systems with
                                mobile apps or other applications requiring data access through an API-enabled interface. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp">If you want your company's existing system integrated with an external application through an interface exposed through an API, then we can help! We have expertise in
                                developing tailored solutions using a variety of programming languages. </p>
