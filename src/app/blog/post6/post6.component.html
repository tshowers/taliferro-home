                                <h3 class="text-capitalize">Taliferro Group is an agile IT services partner </h3>
                                <p> Agile is a set of principles and practices for software development that promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development and delivery, a time-boxed iterative
                                    approach, and continuous improvement. Agile methods encourage rapid and flexible responses to change over following a plan. </p>
                                <p>DevOps is a methodology that improves communication between developers and IT operations staff. By working together, these teams can develop technology more
                                    efficiently: through continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). CI refers to committing code changes into a source repository several times a day,
                                    while CD refers to deploying those changes automatically onto servers or virtual machines (VMs). Businesses can use CI/CD to update their software faster than ever
                                    to respond quickly to market conditions. </p>

                                <p>API-driven applications are web services accessed by mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets over an internet connection. These apps make it easier for users
                                    who may not have in-depth technical skillsets like website development knowledge. </p>

                                    systems with mobile apps or other applications requiring data access through an API-enabled interface. </p>

                                    in developing tailored solutions using a variety of programming languages. </p>
