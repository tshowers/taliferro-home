                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80">If your lab is struggling to keep up with patient demand, our Laboratory Information System (LIS) will have your lab humming. Our LIS software can run your lab smoothly so you can have time for the things that matter most. We'll show you how.</p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> What is a Laboratory Information System? </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp  mb--80">Lab Information Systems (LIS) are software applications that automate the lab workflow. These systems can help manage laboratory operations, automate business processes, improve efficiency, reduce errors, and improve results. 
                                While there are many healthcare systems available for clinical labs, only a handful of these systems have been designed specifically for the laboratory setting.</p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Why use a Lab Information System? </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> Your lab is busy, and you have no time for a sit-down meeting. Heck, you don't even have the time to go over the data in your LIS. If you were any more swamped, you'd
                                be drowning in all of that paperwork! You need something that will track all of your results without fail. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> And once again: why use a Lab Information System? </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp  mb--80">For starters, it's easier for everyone involved when everything about your lab is in one place. Patients can access their test results on their own time (oh joy), and technicians can easily see the tests performed on patients and what needs to be done next time. Managers can track progress on all fronts—all from within the same program. It makes it much harder for mistakes to slip through the cracks because there aren't any cracks left. 
                                A good LIS also integrates with other clinical systems, such as EMRs and pharmacy systems, so that everything stays up-to-date and accurate between departments (which saves valuable hours). And as we've already mentioned above—it's just plain better than having piles upon piles of paper floating around everywhere.</p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp">How to choose the right Laboratory Information System </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Choosing the right Laboratory Information System (LIS) is no easy task. There are many factors to consider, including: </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Flexibility and scalability of the system. Will your needs be simple or complex? Will you need to add more users or expand the database in the future? </li>
                                <li>Integration with other systems in your environment, such as patient management software and billing systems. </li>
                                <li>HIPAA compliance—what does this mean for you? Will it make things easier or harder for your staff to use? What data do you have access to and why do you need it?
                                    How secure are these files from outside threats like hackers or viruses? </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80">Given all of these considerations, choosing a LIS can seem daunting. But don't worry; we've created a handy flowchart that will help guide you through every step of selecting the right system for your lab! Just consider the below points.</p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp">Five ways our Lab Information System will help your lab run efficiently </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Our Lab Information System can help your lab run efficiently in the following ways: </p>
                            <ul class=" mb--80">
                                <li>Reduce the time spent manually entering data. The more efficient you are in entering patient data, the less chance there is of errors and omissions. </li>
                                <li>Reduce the time spent tracking lab results. Our LIS will help you keep track of all test results so that anyone who needs them can easily access them at any time,
                                    regardless of where they are located or when they were conducted. It also allows you to see how many tests have been performed since a particular date range — which
                                    can be invaluable for analyzing trends and comparing different types of analyses (e.g., bacterial cultures). </li>
                                <li>Reduce the time spent generating reports on lab relationships with patients' health conditions over time (i.e., longitudinal studies) based on information gathered
                                    from multiple labs across multiple sites during multiple visits over years' worth of treatment cycles — rather than having to do this manually each time before
                                    sending it out for review/approval from senior management teams etc. </li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp">Our Laboratory Information System is hosted on secure cloud servers and accessed through web browsers </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> This allows our clients to have their data in a format available anywhere, with no software to install or maintain. We can also make upgrades as needed without worrying
                                about deploying new software versions in each lab. This means you don't have to worry about installing updates from us; we'll manage all that for you. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Our LIS uses a sophisticated data management system that allows easy reporting and analysis of lab results. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Our LIS features a user-friendly interface that lets you quickly enter, track and report data for each patient sample.  We've designed our system with an intuitive navigation system that makes accessing information accessible, even if you have no prior experience in the lab. Our LIS will
                                get your lab humming like it was new out of the box—and with all its bells and whistles. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> It has been specifically designed for small to medium-sized laboratories with up to hundreds of users </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp">Our LIS software has been customized for these labs and can be easily adapted to meet your lab's needs. You won't have to worry about learning to use complicated
                                software or paying a lot for upgrades because we've already done that for you. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp  mb--80"> It's easy enough for a student or someone new at the job but powerful enough if your lab has unique needs. You'll get all the functionality you need from starting day
                                one. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> The system supports integration with lab equipment and third-party systems and interfacing with e-commerce systems and patients
                            </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> As a healthcare provider, you will have access to the following: </p>
                            <ul class=" mb--80">
                                <li>Management of all your lab data while interfacing with the other hospital-based departments and systems. </li>
                                <li>Electronic Medical Records (EMR) – an electronic medical record system that allows you to keep track of every patient's history in one place. It also helps
                                    streamline billing processes by providing a single platform where all your billing-related work can be done easily by doctors directly from their computers. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp">Budget friendly and HIPAA compliant</h3>
