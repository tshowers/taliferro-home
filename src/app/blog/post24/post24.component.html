                            <h2 class="wow fadeInUp"> Introduction </h2>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> A business profile helps your website rank higher in search results, which means more people will find you on the web and call you. A Google
                                business profile can also help with search engine optimization (SEO), so if you aren't familiar with this term or why it's essential for your business, let me explain.
                            </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> Search engine optimization (SEO) is when websites appear at the top of search results for specific keywords and phrases people use when
                                searching online. For example, if someone searches "best pizza in town," all websites that have done SEO well enough to have those words on their home page will show up
                                as one of the top results on Google. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Why do you need a Google Business Profile? </h3>
                            <ul class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp">
                                <li> You need to be found. </li>
                                <li> The search engine is the gateway to your customers, and you must get located. </li>
                                <li> Getting found is more important than ranking high on the SERPs (search engine results pages). </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> Ranking for keywords relevant to your business and its customers is crucial because this determines whether or not people will buy from you
                                or contact you with questions about what products or services are available through your company. If you rank for keywords that don't matter to your business or its
                                customers, then your website will never become successful. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> SEO and Getting Found </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> The Google Business Profile is an online resource that supposedly helps you get found by search. It's also a way for people to find and discover
                                your business in the local community. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> The Google Business Profile helps with SEO. You can make sure that customers looking for your products or services can find you easily on
                                Google Maps or other search engines like Bing and Yahoo! </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Google Profile Insights </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Google Profile Insights is a free tool that gives you insight into how people find and interact with your business on Google. It shows you the
                                number of times your business appears in search results and how many people call or visit after seeing your profile. It also provides insights into how satisfied
                                customers are with their interactions with you. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> You can see a breakdown of what keywords led people to your site and which pages they visited while there. This data will help inform future
                                content creation efforts so visitors can find what they need on the site immediately without having to dig through long pages of information (or at least not as much).
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> My Experience with the Google Business Profile </h3>
                            <ul class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp">
                                <li> The process of setting up your Google Business Profile is easy. </li>
                                <li> It's free to set up your profile, and it's free for potential customers to find you on Google Maps, Search, and other places on the web (like when they're
                                    searching for something in an app). </li>
                                <li> But there are many great ways to advertise your business online that are probably better than this. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> Remember that you have to want to be found, meaning the person searching for your business must spell it correctly. </p>
                            <h2 class="wow fadeInUp"> Conclusion </h2>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> People use Google as an information resource when searching for something specific and businesses in general. If your business isn't showing
                                up on Google, you may lose out on sales and customers. To get started right now, go to Go to <a href="https://www.google.com/business/"
