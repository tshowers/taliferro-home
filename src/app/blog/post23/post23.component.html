                            <h2 class="wow fadeInUp"> Introduction </h2>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> We're Taliferro Group and here to tell you about our company. We're not bragging—just stating the facts. We build software that helps other
                                companies solve problems, but we also like to talk about other things: Seattle (our home), APIs (we write them all day), cloud architectures (yay!), and more. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> We love to talk about APIs and API design </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> APIs are the building blocks of the internet. They enable developers to create apps, websites, and businesses that talk to each other. APIs are
                                essential to any modern app or website and are also necessary for everyday life in general. That's why we love API design: it helps us understand how everything works
                                together. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> So what does API design mean? It means that when you're creating an API for a new app or website you're building, you should keep in mind
                                that your users will need clear documentation on how things work—so that they can understand how your product works and use it effectively themselves. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> We've designed a lot of software over the years, but we're new to this blog </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> We're excited about this blog, but you may be wondering: what does it mean? What is the purpose of this blog? </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> We hope that by writing here, we can share our experiences and hear from you. If you have any questions or comments regarding anything in
                                these posts, please feel free to reach out. As we write more blog posts, we'll post them on our LinkedIn and social media channels, Twitter and Facebook. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> We do write code, but we don't always want to talk about that </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> We've written code for a lot of different devices. I've written code for a lot of other technologies and languages. I have personally
                                written code for a lot of different companies and projects. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Sometimes we have something to say, but it's not related to IT Services or anything very techy </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> We're a bit like your friend who always has an opinion on everything and isn't afraid to share it with you, even if you don't want to hear it. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> We're also into philosophy —and if we run out of things to say about IT Services, plenty more topics fit right in this section: life purpose after
                                death; artificial intelligence, eternal youth; immortality...stuff like that. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> We love Seattle and the people who live in and around it. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> We love what we do. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> If you hire us, you will get the best from us. We take great pride in our work and always try to do the right thing for our clients. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> We love IaaS, so we can help you with your cloud architecture </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> Individually, we have a lot of experience building cloud architectures, and we've seen it all. We know what makes for great architecture and
                                what doesn't. Our team members are Google Cloud experts, so they can help you avoid pitfalls, figure out the best path forward for your use cases and ensure you get the
                                most from your cloud platform. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> One of our founders, Tyrone Showers, has been building things on the internet for over 20 years </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> That's right—long before there was an internet and long before there were even computers. Nowadays, he uses a laptop but back in his day, he had to
                                use something called a Commodore 64 if he wanted to build anything. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Tyrone started building things on the internet in 1993 when his employer asked him to help with Expedia.com. Since then, he has helped many
                                companies develop their websites and online presence. Some were small clients, while others were large enterprises such as AT&T and Microsoft. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> We like to share our insights, which is why we're so excited about our blog. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> We genuinely care about the success of our clients and our reputation </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> We care about our clients, we care about their reputation, and we want the best for them. We also care about the community. Our goal is to do right
                                by all of these things. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> We love what we do so much because it allows us to do good for others together. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> We believe it is not enough to do quality work and deliver on time. We care about the success of each client. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> To ensure that we can provide the best possible service for our clients, we hire only the best people and give them the resources they need
                                to complete their projects quickly and efficiently. We put ourselves in your shoes when addressing your needs or answering any questions you may have about using our
                                services. </p>

                                infrastructure is, but we also like to talk about our other passions: Seattle and its people. If you're looking for some help with your technology or business needs, we
                                can help. </p>
