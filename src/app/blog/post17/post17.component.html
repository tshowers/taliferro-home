                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80">We have been using our expertise to build one of the leading laboratory information systems on the market for over two years, and we are confident that it’s the best out there. Whether you’re just starting or looking to upgrade, this article will explain why it’s so great and why you should consider switching to this system. Here are the top five reasons our laboratory information system is the best choice for your business.</p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> It was built from scratch </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80">We designed our laboratory information system to taste. We weren't satisfied with what was on the market, so we built ours from scratch to fit the laboratory process. We've also been able to make continual improvements and updates as needed without having to wait for a new release. Plus, because it's not based on someone else's software, and we are an expert in developing this type of cloud-based software, we better understand how it works than most other companies do.  </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Our engineers are experts in data collection and analysis </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Being data-driven and using laboratory information systems can help laboratories not only focus on their individual needs, but also come up with
                                solutions to problems that may arise. If your laboratory has a difficult time transferring data or collecting information for whatever reason, then perhaps a lab
                                information system could help alleviate some of these difficulties. By getting an idea of where you're at and where you want to go from our experts, we'll be able to
                                determine what best suits your organization and take necessary steps in order to reach your goals. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> While other organizations may offer something similar, sometimes when it comes down to making choices about which lab information system to use, it
                                can be tough to know what's best. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> We allow you to get online anywhere, anytime </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> Are you always on the go? Are you constantly being pulled in a million different directions? With an online system, you can get what you need anytime and anywhere. Need to update your patient information or review lab results? With our LIS, all of this can be done anywhere with internet access. Just log in and get it done! Never worry about lost data again. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> You can use it from any browser or computer </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> This gives us a lot of advantages over most lab LIS products. A web-based LIS means you can use your account from any computer, so there's no need
                                to lug around laptops or desktops. We've also seen that because of this, labs are much more productive because they're able to work with their software at all times,
                                which leads to fewer interruptions in the workflow and therefore increased efficiency overall. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> No installations, no setup, no maintenance </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80">Ever worry about your IT equipment when traveling for work? What about updates? With the LIS Cloud, all you need to access your laboratory data is a laptop and an
                                internet connection - wherever you are in the world!
