                            <h2 class="wow fadeInUp">Introduction</h2>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80">Medical errors are a significant cause of death and injury in the United States. According to the most recent estimates from the Institute of Medicine, preventable medical errors lead to more than 250,000 deaths every year. That's about 100 times the number of Americans killed on 9/11. Even more disturbing, these statistics don't include injuries or illnesses caused by medical errors.</p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp">
                                Use IT solutions that capture the diagnostic meaning
                            </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80">
                                The computer should be able to read and understand the results. If you've had your blood test or another medical exam, you know what the numbers mean—but your doctor may not! The lab test results are stored electronically in a database and can be accessed by anyone with access to it (including patients). But if this information isn't presented clearly, doctors might misinterpret it, order unnecessary tests, or provide incorrect diagnoses. An electronic records system that captures and analyzes data automatically can solve this problem. A well-architected system can present findings directly to clinicians of electronic health records so they don't have to search through different databases for answers or request additional tests just because they're unsure how else they should proceed.
                            </p>

                                Be sure results are fed back to the ordering physician and the patient
                            </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp">
                                Feedback is essential for both the patient and the practitioner. For patients, feedback involves seeing that their labs have been adequately performed and interpreted by a qualified professional; furthermore, they will want to know what these results mean for their current health status or future healthcare needs. For practitioners, you must know the results of your orders. This will help you determine whether or not your treatment plan is working and if any adjustments need to be made.
                            </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp">
                                In terms of delivering results back to practitioners (and patients), there are several different ways this can occur:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    A report could be sent via email or text message with lab results listed therein (e-mailed reports can also include links directly to online portals where actual images from test tubes would be available).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Notifications might come in the form of automated phone calls or texts (or both) alerting providers when an abnormality has been detected in one of their patient's blood tests—fast notifications like these can save lives.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp">
                                Try to avoid non-standardized tests
                            </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp">
                                The next time you're ordering lab tests, make sure to avoid non-standardized tests. These are tests that a medical board has not approved or other governing bodies like the FDA have. In other words, they haven't been tested or approved by experts in the field of medicine.
                            </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80">
                                Labs aren't equipped to handle these tests, so they often cause errors when used by inexperienced individuals. These errors can lead to duplicate testing, unnecessary testing, and confusion in the lab about how to interpret results and what needs to be done next.
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp">
                                Be aware of what you're ordering and why
                            </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp">
                                Understand the problem before starting. You should fully understand what you're ordering and why before you place an order for lab tests. Setting goals before you start is essential so that you can be ambitious but realistic in your expectations. For example, if your goal is to gain more muscle and lose fat, it may not be natural for someone who doesn't work out regularly or has never worked out consistently before to start with a goal of losing 30 pounds within three months (or any specific time frame).
                            </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80">
                                Instead, focus on making minor changes to make each workout more effective and enjoyable—and then reward yourself by hitting milestones along the way.
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp">
                                Don't be afraid to ask questions
                            </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80">
                                The best way to avoid medical errors is to be prepared, and there's no better way to prepare than by asking questions. Lab tests can be complicated and confusing, especially if they're done at a lab that isn't familiar with the patient's history or condition. If you have any questions about what a specific test may reveal, who will interpret its results, or how this information will affect your treatment plan for the patient in question—ask. The more informed you are about your patient's conditions and treatment plans, the less likely it'll be that an incorrect test result will confuse the line.
                            </p>
