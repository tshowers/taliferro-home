                            <h2 class="wow fadeInUp"> Introduction </h2>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> You've probably sent lots of cold calls and messages if you're like me. I know how frustrating it can be when people don't respond to those
                                initial requests—but that doesn't mean you should stop trying. If anything, it's more important than ever to ensure that your next outreach effort is personalized and
                                effective. I'll show you how my CRM is the perfect tool for getting customers engaged with your brand. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> People are busy and don't always respond to cold calls </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> We know that people are busy and often don't respond to cold calls. And while email is a great way to reach out, it's not always the best option
                                for everyone. For example, if you're trying to get in touch with an influencer or someone who doesn't use email regularly, sending an email might be a waste of time.
                            </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> Asking customers how they prefer to be reached can help you figure out where you should focus your efforts when it comes time to reach out.
                                You want to give people multiple options, so they don't feel like their preferred method isn't available or isn't being used by the business as a whole (if this
                                happens). </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> High response rates are tough to achieve without the right tools </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> To be successful, you need to reach out to people. It would help if you also had a way to collect data about your contacts, track progress and see
                                what's working and what isn't. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> To achieve this, I recommend my CRM (customer relationship manager). It's easy to use and will help you stay organized as you grow your
                                business. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Most CRM clients take a reactive approach to their contacts </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> They wait patiently for their connections to respond and then reach out again. This approach is often frustrating and ineffective because the
                                client spends time reaching out repeatedly without any idea of whether or not the contact has responded in the past. The best way to avoid this problem is by being
                                proactive and creating a list of people you want to reach out to right now. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> We take a more proactive approach by adding artificial intelligence to our CRM. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> In a world where every second counts, you don't want to waste time on the wrong people. I have taken a more proactive approach by adding artificial
                                intelligence to my CRM. My AI-powered contact suggestion engine analyzes all your data in real-time and suggests contacts that are likely to be interested in your
                                product or service. All you have to do is log into my CRM will tell you who to contact and why. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> I know firsthand that using a spreadsheet to keep track of contacts and leads is time-consuming, especially when you don't have many leads in the
                                first place. This is why I created my CRM. To help you save time to get more done in the same amount of time. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> How? </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> It suggests contacts based on machine learning so that it's easy for you to reach out and start conversations with people who are ready to buy from
                                you. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> An intuitive interface allows that tracks sales opportunities and manages pipelines. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> I design all tools to help you create an exceptional customer experience </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> I want to help you create an exceptional customer experience, which is why I created a CRM. My mission is to help you find new customers,
                                retain your existing ones and generate more revenue from both audiences. I also want to help you get more referrals from your current clients—if they're happy with the
                                experience they've had working with you, then why wouldn't they recommend their friends or family members? </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> You will make more sales if you use my CRM </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> With my CRM, you will get more sales, leads, and customers. You'll have more opportunities to sell your products or services to businesses ready to
                                buy. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> I'm talking about a big difference here. It's all about capturing the correct data so you can find buyers faster and market more effectively
                                than ever before. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Don't be shy about trying new things </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> The world is full of surprises. You might meet someone who will change your life or find a new place to hang out with friends. And you never know
                                what you'll find in a box of Lucky Charms. It's always worth trying something new—you never know what could happen. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Maybe you haven't given much thought to CRM software before now. But I think it's worth considering. I'm confident that once you try it out, you'll
                                be hooked and won't want to return to the way things used to be. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> One small caveat. It is relatively new and does not offer as many features as other tools on the market. However, I built it for just one
                                thing; when I log in, it tells me who I should contact and why. Since it is natural artificial intelligence needs time to learn since it is natural, but once it gets
                                going, you're rolling. </p>
                            <h2 class="wow fadeInUp"> Conclusion </h2>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> I, too, am learning to sell, but since I'm learning, I built a tool to aid in my progression. If you're not sure if it's right for your
                                business, don't worry. Once you decide if it's a good fit, I will help set up an account and start immediately. </p>
