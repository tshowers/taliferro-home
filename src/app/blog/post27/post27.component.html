                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> A good Laboratory Information System (LIS) meets your needs and helps you to work more efficiently. It should allow you to organize your
                                laboratory workflow, manage the results of samples, and create patient documents and billing documents easily while having an intuitive interface. The best LISs are
                                modular solutions that can be integrated with other applications such as CRM or e-commerce. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> It should manage the laboratory workflow </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> The LIS you choose should be able to manage the workflow, including sample management and order management. It should also be able to handle the
                                results of your lab testsâ€”from registration and validation through data storage (and possibly even analysis). Finally, it should be able to organize patient documents
                                related to the specimens being tested, such as health questionnaires or patient forms. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> In addition, some people may want their LISs to handle billing. If this is something vital for you and your business, make sure that your
                                system has this feature built-in before purchasing it so that there's no need for extra software programs later on down the road. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> It should have an intuitive and ergonomic interface, easy to use and configure </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> A good LIS should have an intuitive and ergonomic interface that is easy to use and configure and can be used on different screens (computers,
                                smartphones, tablets). </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> In addition, it must be able to integrate with other systems within the organization. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> It should allow the user access to data of interest promptly without having to search through multiple layers of information databases or
                                wait for hours for reports generated by different systems that are not connected. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> It should be a modular solution </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> The lab information system must not only be a standalone software solution, but it should also be able to integrate with other applications. For
                                example, if you already have an email system and CRM software, then the laboratory information system should be able to integrate with both. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> Integration with email software will allow you to send emails for order notifications or invoices. Integration with CRM means it can pull in
                                customer profiles when they place an order or request a quote on something in your lab inventory. Finally, integration with lab inventory means that if someone wants to
                                purchase something from the lab (like tests), then this is also possible using the laboratory information system's API (Application Programming Interface). </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> A good Laboratory Information System will significantly facilitate your daily work in the lab </h3>
                            <ul class="wow fadeInUp mb--80">
                                <li> It should make it easier to manage workflow and results, which means fewer mistakes and faster completion of tasks. </li>
                                <li> It should make it easier to manage documents, especially paperwork that requires multiple signatures or approvals. </li>
                                <li> It should simplify both internal billing (for example, between departments) and external billing to customers or payers. </li>
                                <li> A good LIS will integrate with other applications you might use in your business (for example, scheduling software). </li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2 class="wow fadeInUp"> Conclusion </h2>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> A good Laboratory Information System will significantly facilitate your daily work in the lab. It should manage the laboratory workflow
                                (samples management, orders management), the results (registration and validation), documents of samples and patients (patient forms, health questionnaire), and
                                billing. </p>
