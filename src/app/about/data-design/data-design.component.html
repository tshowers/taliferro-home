The most important thing is to avoid creating unnecessary columns, slowing down queries, and preventing you from using the correct data at the right time. If possible, try to store all of your information in one table or use denormalization to combine multiple values into one field.'"

An index helps speed up queries when you\'re looking for specific data points within a tableâ€”it\'s basically like a map that tells SQL how to find rows based on their values. But indexes can also hurt performance if they\'re too large or poorly designed, so keep them small and relevant.'"
