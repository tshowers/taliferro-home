                            <h2 class="wow fadeInUp"> Introduction </h2>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> In the past, businesses had to invest heavily in their information technology and development teams to get a competitive edge. But thanks to the
                                internet, companies can now find a wealth of free online resources that they can use to improve their business, such as open source platforms and APIs. The problem is
                                that many companies don't take advantage of these resources because they're afraid of what might happen if something goes wrong with them; however, there are plenty of
                                ways for businesses to leverage a variety of existing tools without putting themselves at risk. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Companies are afraid to use what's freely available </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> The other day, I talked to a friend who works at a large corporation, and she mentioned that they had just been assigned a project requiring them
                                to collect data on their customers. She told me how her team had spent weeks figuring out how they would do it. They knew they needed the information but weren't sure
                                if they could get it without investing in expensive software or hiring an outside company (which would take even longer). </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> As I listened, I wondered why no one had thought about using Google Analytics for this purpose. It seemed evident that using Google Analytics would
                                be much easier and cheaper than anything else. The only thing stopping them from doing it was their fear of failure or uncertainty about what precisely needed to be
                                done. We all have concerns like these when faced with new challenges or situations where we need help getting through something difficult - but these fears are not
                                valid reasons for avoiding using freely available resources. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Companies are afraid to hire the right expertise </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> If a company is running on its own, it's natural that it wants to be its hero and do everything itself. But if you think about it, there is no such
                                thing as "doing it all" by yourself. You will always need help and support from others. You are afraid to hire the right people. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> The best way to get better results is by hiring the right expertise when needed instead of trying to do everything on your own (and failing). This
                                goes for small businesses and large corporations - don't be afraid of bringing in experts or even hiring outside your industry. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> And they're afraid to invest in their own people. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> I know this sounds like a crazy thing to say, but it's true. Companies are afraid to invest in their people and resources because they get stuck on
                                the old way of doing things. They're so scared that it won't work or will cost them more money than expected if they support it. And if we're honest with ourselves. But
                                what happens when you invest in yourself? You grow your business. And it doesn't have to be complicated or expensive either. All you need is passion and dedication (and
                                maybe some chocolate). </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Plenty of resources are available, and companies should be more open-minded about trying new things. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Don't tell me that your company doesn't have the budget or expertise to do something. Just hire someone who can get it done. </p>
                            <h2 class="wow fadeInUp"> Conclusion </h2>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> There's no question that great resources exist for companies to use. The problem is that many businesses are still reluctant to try new things or
                                invest in their people. It takes courage and vision to do something different, but those who do it will find themselves on the right side of history. The takeaway here?
                                Don't be afraid. If you're running a company, then take some time out of your busy schedule today (or whenever) and think about what kind of resources would help you
                                grow even faster than before. And if you're not running one yet but want to start one soon, well, do it. You never know where inspiration can come from, so don't let
                                anything stop you from following your dreams, no matter how far off they seem at first glance. </p>
