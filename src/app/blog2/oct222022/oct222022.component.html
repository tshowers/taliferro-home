                            <h2 class="wow fadeInUp"> Introduction </h2>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> When was the last time you heard about a company losing over one and a half billion dollars on its home page? The answer is never. Amazon is not
                                only the largest online retailer in the world but also one of the most successful companies within e-Commerce. Amazon has over 100 million products for sale, making
                                billions every year due to their popularity among consumers. If you go onto any website that sells products, chances are good that they will have an affiliate link
                                which means they're trying to make money off your clicks and purchases. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Page load </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Page load is the time it takes for a web page to load completely. It's measured in seconds and can be measured by tools such as Google PageSpeed
                                Insights, Pingdom, and WebPagetest. As you might imagine, page speed is essential for commerce sites because it impacts how quickly you can complete your order and get
                                what you bought delivered to your door. Pages that take too long to load create an uncomfortable user experience that makes customers leave and go elsewhere, which
                                means lost sales for the business owner. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Why does page speed time matters </h3>
                            <ul class="wow fadeInUp">
                                <li> It can affect your customer engagement, conversion rates, and sales </li>
                                <li> It can affect your search engine ranking </li>
                                <li> It can affect your bounce rate </li>
                                <li> It can affect your mobile experience </li>
                                <li> It can affect your brand </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Page load speed is a measure of how quickly your webpage loads. The page speed tool in Chrome gives you a score of 100; the lower the score, the
                                slower your page will load. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> The faster a page loads, the more likely visitors will stay on your website and continue interacting with it instead of clicking away to another
                                site (or even just closing their browser altogether). </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Speed up your website </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Consider using a CDN to make your site faster if you have a WordPress website. If your site is hosted on Amazon AWS and has a lot of traffic, you
                                might consider moving it off the free tier and onto the paid tier. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> If you are not on Amazon AWS, but would still like to make your site faster, consider adding some caching plugins, such as W3 Total Cache or WP
                                Rocket. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> The best way to speed up any website without paying for anything is by not loading unnecessary things that don't add value for users. We must
                                minimize: </p>
                            <ul class="wow fadeInUp">
                                <li> Requests - Avoid having too many stylesheets or scripts loaded at once; this makes switching between pages slower because more connections are being made ​ </li>
                                <li> Plugins - The fewer plugins there are running on the front end (i.e., those that visitors can see), the better​ </li>
                                <li> Redirects - Don't use redirects unless they're necessary (for example, if you have an old URL with no 301 redirects) </li>
                                <li> Third parties​ - Avoid third-party scripts as much as possible; they're often slower than serving content directly from your own servers </li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Minimize the cost of a slow site </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> When building a website, there are many things to consider when making your site fast. You can <a routerLink="/website-optimization">optimize</a> images, minify code and decrease latency
                                using a CDN (Content Delivery Network). </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Let's say an average product has 20 elements; then, we have 20 HTTP requests per page! That's already 8 million HTTP requests per day just for one
                                site! Imagine if all websites had such high numbers. Our browser would never get any work done because it would be busy loading pages repeatedly (or at least until
                                someone visited). </p>
                            <h2 class="wow fadeInUp"> Conclusion </h2>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> If you're running a business, you want your site to be as fast and efficient as possible. A slow website can hurt your business by reducing
                                conversions, increasing bounce rates, and driving users away. By following the tips mentioned, you'll be able to keep your visitors happy while saving some money along
                                the way! </p>
