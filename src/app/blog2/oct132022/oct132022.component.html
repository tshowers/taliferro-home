                            <h2 class="wow fadeInUp">Introduction </h2>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> Everyone has a different definition of leadership. Some people believe it's about platitudes, or is it? Leadership is an elusive quality, but how
                                you inspire others matters most. It takes a strong personality to lead and understand the different types of leaders out there - because we all are leaders in some way
                                or another. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Please don't take it for granted </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Leadership is a privilege, not a right. You may think you are entitled to be in charge because you were born first or because you have the best
                                office and an enormous desk, but even if those things are true (and they're probably not), that doesn't mean leadership is something that's owed to anyone. It's not
                                like leadership falls from the sky as rainbows or unicorns do; it has to be worked for and earned—and often, it can be challenging to find as either mythical creature
                                would be. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> Leadership is also a responsibility rather than an expectation or entitlement. You aren't automatically entitled to all the respect that comes with
                                being in charge simply because of your position; instead, it's up to YOU (yes again!) to earn this respect by doing what's suitable for everyone around you—not just
                                yourself! And if no one else agrees with how well YOU are doing at this whole leading-people thing? Maybe it's time for self-reflection before jumping back into another
                                leadership role. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Don't be a leader without followers </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> As a leader, you are the one who sets the direction and inspires others to follow. It would help if you had followers to be a leader. Without
                                followers, there is no leadership. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> Leadership is not just about inspiring people; it's also about motivating them toward a shared goal. If your team hasn't bought into your vision
                                and isn't willing to put in the work required for success, then there's no way you can lead them successfully. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Decide who you want your followers to be </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Decide who you want your followers to be. Knowing who you're leading and what they need from you is the most crucial part of leadership. If you
                                don't know who you are teaching—their demographic profile, experiences, and expectations—you can't effectively guide them toward their goals or achieve yours. You won't
                                know what tools or tactics are best for reaching your audience. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> If the person in front of them isn't properly prepared for the task at hand (or doesn't have the skills needed), it's easy enough for them to fall
                                back on platitudes instead of being honest with themselves about what's holding them before today. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Women as Leaders </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> I always felt that women were better leaders. They were more prepared. They had their shit together and knew what they wanted to do. On the other
                                hand, men were all over the place—they didn't know what they wanted or how to get it. I couldn't tell you how often I've heard my father say that men are inherently
                                lazy and incapable of authentic leadership. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> It wasn't until later in life that I realized he was a bit wrong about that assessment: Men are definitely capable of being leaders; it's just not
                                their natural inclination because of how society has conditioned them from childhood onward to behave differently than women across almost every facet of life from
                                education to career opportunities and even at home (e.g., having wives who take care of children vs. husbands doing chores around the house). </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> We are all leaders who can make our own choices </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> If you're a leader, you might be surprised to hear this. But leadership isn't just something that happens to people with fancy titles or who work
                                at fancy companies. Leadership is an attitude. It's a choice. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Leadership isn't about the title on your business card, the size of your office, or the amount of money you make—it's about how you choose to lead
                                yourself and others by example every day. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Leaders are people that create value and use it to achieve their purpose. Leaders are people who have a purpose and use their leadership skills to
                                achieve that purpose. They create new ideas, develop teams, and make the world a better place for everyone. You can't be a leader if you don't create value. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> A leader's job is to inspire others to follow them toward the future they've created for themselves and those around them. Being a positive force
                                in your world will help give you an edge over other candidates with similar resumes; after all, who wouldn't want someone leading them who has already proven themselves
                                as someone with high character? </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Leadership is an elusive quality, but how you inspire others matters most </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> It's one of those things that we all know it means, but no one can quite define it. We all have a leader in our lives and have seen different types
                                of leaders, but the question remains: What makes someone a good leader? </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> First, let's talk about the qualities most often associated with leadership. The first thing people think of when they talk about leadership is
                                some platitude or cliché like "leadership is character" or "leaders lead from the front" (or something like that). These statements are accurate as far as they go, but
                                they don't explain much; this type of thinking leads to another round of platitudes rather than any meaningful insight into how one might become better at leading
                                others. The best way I've found to explain this concept is through examples from everyday life: </p>
                            <h2 class="wow fadeInUp"> Conclusion </h2>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp mb--80"> Leadership is a funny thing. It can be a complex concept, but it's always easy to recognize when someone else is doing it. Leadership isn't about
                                power or authority; it's about inspiring others to follow you in pursuit of your vision. If you want others to follow you, lead by example and show them how awesome it
                                feels. The accurate measure of leadership is not how many people follow us but how many lives we change for the better because of what we do as leaders. </p>
