                            <h2 class="wow fadeInUp"> Introduction </h2>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Everyone is talking about digital transformation, but what does it mean? Technology offers organizations many benefits, including improved
                                efficiency, reduced costs, and new growth opportunities. At Taliferro Group, we believe that to create a successful digital transformation strategy, you need to start
                                with what you want to achieve. The focus should then be on solving those problems using digital technologies within your organization. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp">Getting Started</h3>
                            <p> Digital Transformation is a goal that all organizations aim for, and the Covid-19 pandemic has only made it more of a priority. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> To successfully transition to a digital business, you need to understand what your current business model looks like and be able to define your
                                target state. You must also have the ability to execute this plan. The following steps can help guide you in making this change: </p>
                            <ul class="wow fadeInUp">
                                <li> Identify your Business Processes - This first step involves identifying all of the processes within your organization that are business critical and determining
                                    how each one works by using BPMN 2.0 diagrams. I recommend using tools such as Visio or Lucidchart, which provide built-in templates for these diagrams, making them
                                    easy to create and understand. </li>
                                <li> Automate them with AI - Once we've identified the processes, we can start automating them with Artificial Intelligence (AI). Still, first, we must remember where
                                    AI can add value for us to determine how much effort needs to be put into automating them versus manual work outsourced offshore, etc. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p> However, many organizations struggle with being able to define "Digital Transformation." </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> You must clearly understand what you want to achieve by moving into the digital world. If your organization hasn't defined what it means by digital
                                transformation, take some time to do so. You can use our Digital Transformation Maturity Model as a guide while describing this aspect of your organization. It will
                                help ensure everyone is on the same page when discussing digital transformation. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Define what you want to achieve by moving into the digital world and how it will impact your customer experience strategy, customer journey, and
                                business processes. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Create an overarching vision for how you want things to look once you've successfully implemented these changes - this informs all other aspects of
                                your plan (e.g., customer experience). </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Digital Transformation means different things to different people </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Digital transformation is a change in business processes, technology, and operations. It's not a one-size-fits-all approach. The goals of digital
                                transformation are based on the organization's vision and business strategy. Some organizations focus on customer experience. Others focus on cost efficiency or
                                internal integration. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Digital transformation is a continuous process with no fixed time span or deliverables. The aim is to improve continuously while staying aligned
                                with your corporate strategy, so it's essential to ensure your digital system is updated annually or whenever significant changes in the market or technology landscape
                                (e.g., when new channels become available). </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Digital transformation is a process and not a goal. It's not just about technology, innovation, or efficiency. It is an essential thing that you
                                can do to help your business succeed in today's digital age. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> We believe that to create a successful digital transformation strategy, it would help if you started with what you want to achieve. During this
                                process, we will ask questions such as: </p>
                            <ul class="wow fadeInUp">
                                <li> What are your objectives? </li>
                                <li> What are your goals? </li>
                                <li> How do you measure success? </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> The focus should be on solving those problems using digital technologies within your organization. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> It's essential to focus on the problem you're trying to solve rather than the solution. Many people get caught up in "we should do this" or "we
                                should do that," but it's more valuable to think about what your customers want and how we can improve their lives using technology. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Setting a goal before you start is essential for success; if we don't know where we're going, it's easy to get lost along the way. It could be as
                                simple as ensuring your website works well on mobile phones or ensuring you're up-to-date with GDPR laws. Still, both are achievable goals that will improve your
                                business while stimulating innovation in other areas. We can help you. Technology offers organizations many benefits,
                                including: </p>
                            <ul class="wow fadeInUp">
                                <li> Cost savings - using technology in your business can reduce costs and increase efficiency. This could include reducing staff hours by automating manual processes
                                    such as data entry or completing jobs traditionally performed on-site remotely via mobile devices. </li>
                                <li> Efficiency - technology also helps improve productivity by enabling employees to work more effectively, making them more productive and motivated in their roles.
                                </li>
                                <li> New growth opportunities - by increasing efficiencies and improving processes, companies can grow quicker than ever while minimizing risk factors associated with
                                    expanding into new markets or territories (like hiring new people). </li>
                                <li> New revenue streams - digital transformation provides opportunities to expand on existing services or create entirely new products/services. Thanks to advances in
                                    technology over recent years, like cloud computing services, an organization doesn't need as much capital upfront compared with how things were done previously.
                                    </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Organizations can achieve their desired outcomes using tools such as cloud computing services and artificial intelligence (AI). As an organization,
                                you may be considering how to transform your business. You could be looking to improve efficiency or save costs by adopting new technologies. AI can help you do both of
                                these things. Organizations can achieve their desired outcomes using tools such as cloud computing services and artificial intelligence (AI). AI is a computer system
                                that can learn, think and make decisions based on past experiences. AI allows organizations to automate tasks that would otherwise require human support or
                                intervention; this frees up staff for other tasks that are more suited for them. If you are looking for help with your digital transformation strategy, we can help you.
