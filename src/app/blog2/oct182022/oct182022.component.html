                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Too many apps can be overwhelming, especially if you're one of those who has to have every app under the sun. And that's not just a problem in your
                                phone—it's also a problem for your computer, which may have an even higher app count than your cell phone. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Some people are okay with this approach, but others feel like they're drowning in app notifications or feeling stressed by too many options and
                                distractions. There's even a term for it: "app fatigue." It happens when you start getting frustrated with all the apps on your phone or computer because they're
                                bogging down your productivity and making it hard for you to focus on what matters for any given task. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Welcome to the world of app fatigue. I know it's not an official diagnosis, but if you're feeling tired and overwhelmed by too much technology in
                                your life, then this article is for you. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Are you tired of logging into so many different apps? </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Do you feel your attention is being hijacked by the apps designed to get and keep it? Are you stressed by how much time you spend on social media
                                or with Facebook Messenger and Whatsapp in the background? If so, then you may be suffering from app fatigue. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Are you tired of changing your passwords for so many different apps? </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> With so many apps, each with its password and security system, it's impossible to keep track of your passwords and ensure you're using strong
                                enough ones. Because of this, you've probably changed your password for an app at least once in the past month. Or even today! Here's what happens: You find out about a
                                new app or service on Facebook or Twitter (or from one of the many newsletters flooding your inbox). You sign up for it because it looks cool, fun, and valuable. You
                                log into the app with your email address. Think back to all those other services that already have access to your info through these same channels but aren't
                                necessarily as good as this new one. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Are you tired of setting up new accounts on so many different apps? Are you tired of remembering all those passwords and having your profile
                                information, security questions, and answers constantly change because companies are trying to do a better job securing their systems? You're not alone! If this sounds
                                like something that's been happening to you lately, then it might be time to take a break from app fatigue. </p>

                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Too many apps can be overwhelming </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> You have so many apps that you can't keep track of them all. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> You have many passwords to remember, and they're all in different apps. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> You can't find what you need when it matters most because the app isn't readily available on your phone's home screen or has been forgotten
                                altogether (or both). </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Too many apps can make you feel stressed. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> You know that feeling of stress and anxiety comes from too many apps on your phone? Well, it's not just in your head. Stress is a real problem in
                                the modern world. Do you suffer from insomnia, headaches, or frequent colds? If so, there's a good chance that stress is to blame. Too many apps can stress you because
                                they're full of things that distract you—from emails and notifications to games and social media. Even though some apps are designed to help us cope with stress (like
                                mindfulness apps), they still add more tasks to our daily lists. And if we don't manage our time wisely, all those extra tasks can cause even more stress down the road
                                when we feel like we're falling behind on life goals due to all those distractions catching up with us at once. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Fortunately for app lovers everywhere: there are ways around this problem. You can take steps towards reducing app fatigue by setting specific
                                hours during which each type of app should be used so as not to overwhelm yourself by having them constantly running throughout the day (including sleeping). For
                                example: limit checking email only between 10am–12pm every Monday through Friday; restrict browsing social media accounts until after dinner each night; etc. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Too many apps can inhibit productivity </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> If you're experiencing app fatigue, you may have noticed that staying focused on a single task is difficult. You can get distracted by the number
                                of apps you have open and the number of notifications coming in. It can be hard to find the right app for a particular task—especially if it's unavailable on your
                                device—and even more so when there are dozens or hundreds of choices. </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Too many app notifications can cause phone fatigue </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> You already know that notifications can be a huge distraction. Apps can also be the source of much anxiety. I'm getting
                                notifications from so many apps that my phone practically screams at me all day. But as an app user, I've found myself unable to resist opening every app that pings me
                                with a new notification. And once I open an app and find out it's not really for me (or even just not relevant to what I'm working on), I immediately want to close it.
                                Then another notification comes in from another app, which sends me back into a cycle of opening-and-closing apps until my brain gets tired enough for me to ignore them
                                altogether. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> This isn't good! Too many notifications can cause phone fatigue: too much effort expended trying and failing over and over again takes its toll on
                                your productivity and stress levels (and hey—you might even miss out on some essential news). </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Apps are designed to get and keep your attention, but that is not always a good thing, and they often hijack your attention and focus. Apps can be
                                addictive, distracting, and time-consuming. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Apps can be addictive in the same way that eating chocolate is addictive or having sex is addictive. There are no immediate physical withdrawal
                                symptoms if you don't use an app at all—but once you're hooked on an app, it's hard to stop using it. You may have heard of people who "check" Facebook every few
                                minutes because doing so makes them feel connected to their friends and family (even though they rarely post anything themselves). </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> If you find yourself compulsively checking social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram every few minutes and then feeling bad about yourself
                                for doing so, then chances are high that these tools were designed specifically with our human psychology in mind. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> There may be an app addiction problem in some people, but we all need to look at how technology affects our lives, emotions, and behavior. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> What if those apps weren't so useless after all? What if they were controlling the way we behaved and felt? </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> What if they could turn us into zombies? </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> That may seem like a stretch, but it's not entirely impossible. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> So what do we do about this? Limit screen time? Delete social media apps from our phones altogether? </p>
                            <h3 class="title mb--30 text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> There is an app for everything now, but there comes a time when we have to say, "enough is enough" </h3>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> You know the feeling: You're sitting at a red light, and another driver on their phone swerves into your lane. You look at them with disgust,
                                knowing they have been distracted from driving by their smartphone. But then you wonder if you are any better off; perhaps it is time for you to take stock of your
                                habits and maybe even make some changes. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> The first step is admitting there may be a problem—and if there isn't one, then maybe it isn't too late for someone out there who has an issue with
                                technology overuse. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Once we admit we have an addiction problem, things often get worse before they get better. The next step is finding help; whether this means seeing
                                a doctor or getting some counseling sessions doesn't matter as long as it helps us overcome our addiction issues. </p>
                            <h2 class="wow fadeInUp">Conclusion</h2>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> We all love apps and don't want to give them up. But if you are feeling anxious or stressed by the number of apps you have, perhaps it's time to
                                cut back on some of them. You should also consider limiting your use of social media, email, and other online platforms because they can also be overwhelming. If your
                                life is becoming unmanageable because of too many notifications coming at once, then maybe it's time for an intervention. </p>
