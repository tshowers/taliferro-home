                            find a wealth of free online resources that they can use to improve their business, such as open source platforms and APIs. The problem is that many companies don't take
                            advantage of these resources because they're afraid of what might happen if something goes wrong with them; however, there are plenty of ways for businesses to leverage a
                            variety of existing tools without putting themselves at risk.</p>

                            your organization needs a digital transformation strategy to help you adapt to these changes and remain relevant as a business. The first step in any digital transformation
                            project is figuring out where you want it to go. This means defining goals, KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), cost structures, and timelines for delivery before embarking

                            retailer in the world but also one of the most successful companies within e-Commerce. Amazon has over 100 million products for sale, making billions every year due to
                            their popularity among consumers. If you go onto any website that sells products, chances are good that they will have an affiliate link which means they're trying to make
                            money off your clicks and purchases.</p>

                        <p>You run a Shopify store and decide to use one of those third-party widgets to add some functionality to your store. You know customers are less likely to buy from sites with
                            slow response times. For example, on Amazon, a page load slowdown of just one second measured across their website could cost them $1.6 billion in sales each year.</p>

                        <p> With the number of software development jobs increasing yearly and the demand for developers growing, there's never been a better time to be in IT. The only problem is that
                            developers don't all come from the same background. Many programmers today learn their trade online without university degrees or professional experience. Others went to
                            school and got degrees in computer science before they started working as an architect - but what makes one type better than another? </p>

                        <p> I was talking with a friend about agile development and how Procedure can sometimes slow you down. We were talking about this other friend who's been working in an agile
                            environment for years now, and he just couldn't figure out why things weren't moving as fast as they used to. He was frustrated because he felt like his team wasn't getting
                            anything done anymore. </p>
